## Adventure Game (Taking the L)

For my midterm Adventure Game, I decided to put a spin on Chicago's infamous CTA "L" trains and create a fun little exploration with it. In this game, You are helping Lee Crooks, the "Voice of the CTA" find five items at five random stations to help him with recording lines for a future CTA expansion project. Your goal is want various "L" routes across Chicago and decide to whether get off at a station or not. The play factor here is that not every station includes items and some have traps that will affect your gameplay.
